Ich habe da erst erfahren, dass physische Nähe besser möglich ist als vorher gedacht","In der Pflege wird etwas Wärme benötigt, das könnte ein Roboter mit Kunstfell etwas schaffen","Erschreckend zu lesen, wie sich diese Technologien und Gedanken entwickeln (also der Text zu den soften Robotern). Erschreckend in dem Sinne, da ich dann bereits gewisse negativen Folgen antizipiere, wenn ich über softe Roboter lese.\n\nEine erschreckende Welt, in der schwache Menschen ruhig gestellt werden. \n\nIch sehe natürlich auch die möglichen Vorteile, wenn man diese Technologie sehr ethisch benützen würde. Aber, meiner Meinung nach, ist es leider so, dass die Menschen sehr oft unethisch handeln, wenn sie dadurch einen persönlichen Vorteil erlangen. \n\nIst ein interessantes Thema und ich bin nicht generell gegen die Roboter-Forschung oder -Einsatz, aber das muss alles sehr genau begleitet und evaluiert werden. \n\nMomentan suchen alle Pfleger, weil es ein sehr harter Job ist, den nicht viele machen wollen. Was passiert, wenn man Roboter dazufügt. Die Menschen werden noch weniger Pflegetätigkeit ausüben, also insbesondere die bezahlten Pflegekräfte. Ist ein komplexes Thema, kann das nicht alles jetzt hier erörtern. Wenn z.B. eine Familie liebevoll (!) ein Elternteil zu Hause (!) pflegt, dann sind natürlich Roboter potentiell extrem vorteilhaft und wichtig und erleichternd. Sehen Sie was ich meine? Es geht um die menschliche Natur, egoistisch und unethisch zu handeln vs. die menschliche Natur ethisch und liebevoll und selbstlos zu handeln.","Ich hatte den größten Nachteil in der Bedienung des Roboters gesehen (geht evtl. nicht direkt aus der ersten Mind-Map hervor). Diese Nachteile wurde durch die neuen Informationen zu Softrobotern entkräftet.\n\n","Wurde auf die Haltbarkeit der Soft Roboter Hingewiesen. Dies hat mich darüber nachdenken lassen, ob diese Systeme wirklich Robust genug sind um Rettungsroboter zu sein. ","Weil ein Softroboter meiner Meinung nach weniger Nachteile hat als ein harter","Ich habe zwar auch negative Dinge ergänzt, die ich anfangs nicht bedacht habe wie die Verletzungsgefahr bei \"Harten\" Robotern, aber mir ist die Komponente des \"Immer daseins\", des \"Glücklich machens\", der \"passgenaueren Therapie\" durch die Beschreibung von soften Robotern noch etwas klarer geworden. Dass der Roboter wirklich ein ständiger Begleiter praktisch ist. Das wurde mir da noch etwas mehr bewusst als ich die Beschreibung las, er praktisch immer mit den entsprechenden Personen interagiert. Und praktisch wie ein Haustier auch sein kann.","Ein softer Roboter hat einen geringeren Anschaffungsaufwand. Außerdem ein geringeres Verletzungsrisiko und eine kürzere Entwicklungsdauer. Weiterhin entlastet er das Personal in einem speziellen Bereich.","Die verschiedenen Beispiele haben mir etwas die Augen geöffnet und nochmal intensiver mit dem Thema zu denken gegeben. Die Robbe war ein gutes Beispiel ein erweitertes Nutzungsszenario in den Gedanken zu rufen und da ein Paar mehr Vorteile zu sehen.","Positive Eigenschaften der Soft-Roboter sind im Vordergrund, da die Unterstützende Effekte die Arbeit einfacher gestalten könnte.","Meiner Meinung nach habe ich meine Ideen ausreichend in meinem Mindmap erklärt.","Das Konzept eines Hybriden Systems vereinigt die positiven Aspekte des Roboters (Sicherheit, Feinarbeit, Autopilot) und gibt nochmal Menschen eine Chance diese zusätzlich zu steuern. Beispiel: \n\n- Während der Bilderkennungsalgorithmus jemanden übersehen würde, so können die Bedienenden jemanden im Kriesengebiet erkennen\n- Präzision ist im aktuellen Kontext wichtig, so kann man einfach auf Autopilot schalten, und eine Rettungsroutine einleiten\n\nMeiner Meinung nach, ist KI aktuell nicht soweit ausgereift, so dass es genügend Schnittstellen eingebaut werden müssen, wo man als Bedienender eingreifen können soll.","Ich dachte, Soft-Aid-Roboter seien nützlicher als normale Roboter. und ich denke, dass dies eine wichtige Rolle bei der Pflege älterer Menschen spielen wird","Softe Roboter machen Roboter menschenähnlicher, d.h. Menschen können auf einer emotionalen Ebene mit ihnen kommunizieren und interagieren. Ein sehr wichtiges Manko eines Roboters ist seine Emotionslosigkeit und diese wird durch einen soften Roboter gemildert, oder möglicherweise irgendwann sogar vollständig aufgehoben.","Die Informationen zu den Soft Robotern haben mich dazu bewegt, etwas positiver über den Einsatz von Assistenzrobotern zu denken. Die Infos waren neu für mich und haben meinen Horizont dahingehend erweitert.","Ich finde die soften Roboter bringen fast nur positives mit sich. Bei den negativen Eigenschaften hat sich für mich der Unterschied von \"harten\" zu \"soften\" Robotern kaum Unterschied gegeben. Durch das softe wurden die Roboter menschlicher.","Insgesamt war es positiver. Ich hatte einen Fehler auf der vorherigen MAP und habe \" Ethik\" zum negative geändert.","Die Vorstellung, soft Robots zu nutzen kommt mir angenehmer vor als die, menschlich anmutende Roboter zu nutzen. Denn ich denke, menschlich gehaltene Roboter werden häufig als gruselig wahrgenommen. Ich habe mit Menschen mit Demenz gearbeitet und weiß hingegen, wie diese auf tierartige, süße Wesen reagieren (positiv).","Ich habe einen negativen Aspekt hinzugefügt. Durch softe roboter erscheint mir dass die unterscheidung von mensch und maschine zunehmend schwieriger wird. Dies sehe ich als problematisch an","Die Erwähnung potenzieller Schäden an soften Robotern in gefährlichen Umgebungen könnte als nachteilig betrachtet werden. Zudem könnte die fortlaufende Diskussion über mögliche Algorithmenvoreingenommenheit und die potenziell eingeschränkte Präzision von soften Rettungsrobotern zu einer negativeren Wahrnehmung beigetragen haben.","Die Vor- und Nachteile des Soft-Roboters hat mein Bild von Robotern in der Pflege nicht beeinflusst. Ich hatte Punkte wie Verletzungsgefahr oder eine schlechte emotionale Bindung gar nicht in der ersten Mind Map erwähnt, so dass ich sie nicht in der Mind Map überarbeiten musste.","Der Einsatz von soften Robotern war mir vorher nicht bekannt. Die Vorteile scheinen, meines Erachtens nach, die Nachteile zu überwiegen, weshalb ich einen positiven Aspekt zu meiner Mindmaps hinzugefügt habe.","Weil softe Roboter  erheblich freundlicher wirken können und bereichernder sind","Obwohl soft robotics einige Vorteile haben, haben mich einige der Vorteile dieser Art von Robotern auch auf Nachteile aufmerksam gemacht (wie zum Beispiel das Verletzungsrisiko herkömmlicher Roboter).","Die Erklärungen zeigten mir einen anderen Aspekt","Die Eigenschaft \"soft\" verschafft dem Roboter in bestimmten Anwendungen Vorteile, z.B. bei Assistenz für demente, Kinder usw. Eine rein technische Maschine wird dort weniger akzeptiert, auch wenn sie sehr kompetent ist.","Einen weiteren positiven Punkt nach dem Lesen des Artikels zu soften Robotern erkannt.","Die Emotionale Bewertung ist ziemlich ähnlich und so empfinde ich auch. Ich nehme \"Richtige Roboter\" als stärker wahr und so, dass die wirklich helfen können. Soft Roboter können eher als Kundschafter dienen","Ein weicher Roboter wird menschenähnlicher, deshalb wird das Gefühl verloren, dass es fremd ist. Aber dazu kommt noch das Angst, dass etwas menschenähnlich ist, aber gar kein Mensch. ","Ich habe die Softer Roboter positiver wahrgenommen da diese sich besser und natürlicher bewegen können und dadurch weniger Verletzungsrisiko für eventuelle Opfer und Patienten bietet.","Einen Begleiter(SoftRobot) zu haben, der nicht schädlich und realistisch ist, kann dabei helfen, Stress und Einsamkeit zu reduzieren.","Wenn durch bestimmte Szenarien eine schnelle Rettung nicht durchgeführt werden kann (z.B. Verschüttete bei Erdbeben), ist eine Versorgung der Opfer essenziel, kann aber auf Grund von Enge oder Einsturzgefährdung nicht unmittelbar durch die Retter erfolgen.","Die soften Roboter haben meiner Meinung nach den großen Nachteil, dass sie leicht beschädigt werden können. Gerade, da diese Rettungsroboter an Orten eingesetzt werden sollen, die gefährlich für Menschen sind (z.B. enge Höhlen, Höhlen mit Unterwassereingängen) und ich daher denke, dass die Roboter aus sehr widerstandsfähigem Material gefertig werden sollten. Beim Beispiel der RoBoa frage ich mich, ob eine Schlange nicht vielleicht auch sehr schnell steckenbleiben könnte.","weil mir Aufgefallen ist , das ich einen Nachteil vergessen hatte","kein wirklicher grund, ich sehe neue technologie eher kritisch da, deswegen ist meine Bewertung negativer geworden","Obwohl die von mir erwähnten Punkte nicht genau mit Ihren Punkten übereinstimmen, habe ich sie zu denselben Punkten dargelegt. Ich habe nichts gesehen, was ich ändern könnte.","Ich habe sie nicht negativer war genommen.","Der Rettungsroboter ist überall sehr nützlich und hat viel Potenziell in der Zukunft.","Hauptsächlich wegen der Emotionalen Abhängigkeit, da dies sehr negative Auswirkungen auf die Interaktion mit anderen Menschen haben kann","Ich denke, Softroboter unterscheiden sich nicht von normalen Robotern","Ich denke Softroboter können eine positive Ergänzung medizinischer Assistenzsysteme sein.","Mir angegebenen Daten also über Soft-Robotern haben gezeigt, dass es mehr Vorteile als Nachteile gibt.","Die Möglichkeit der Fernsteuerung der Roboter wurde im zweiten Text hervorgehoben. Während der ersten Version hatte ich das nicht mit einbezogen.","Softe Asistenz Roboter haben nicht ganz so viele negativ aspekte wie das was ich zuerst als Asistenz Roboter verstanden habe. Es kommt immernoch auf die richtige Anwednung an. Aber das beschriebene Konzept wirkt deutlich weniger Gefährlich und missbrauchsanfällig als die nutzung \"richtiger\" Roboter die ggf. genutzt werden um Stellen komplett zu ersetzen.","Der emotionale Faktor ist meiner Meinung nach negativ, denn wenn jemand seinen persönlichen Roboter verliert, weird das auf jeden Fall Herzzerreißend sein.","Mir sind weitere Vorteile eingefallen, weil ich beim ersten Mal mehr an ein Metallisches Roboter Ding gedacht habe. Beim zweiten Mal hatte ich eher eine Art Haustier im Kopf und diese Vorstellung gefiel mir viel besser, die Nachteile haben sich allerdings nicht erhöht, zumindest für mich.","Nachteile führen dazu, dass die viele lebende Person negativ beeinflusst könnte","Das Beispiel des soften Roboters mit der Robbe hat sich sehr schön angehört. Ich bin eher skeptisch gegenüber diesem Thema, da man notwendige menschliche Interaktion vielleicht versucht zu ersetzen. Es klingt sehr schwierig und bedenklich. Andererseits ist es notwendig und hat sicher einen Nutzen. Traurige Menschen, die alleine Leben können so aufgeheitert werden. \n","Ich habe zuvor nicht an etwas wie Soft-Roboter gedacht, finde die Vorstellung einer kleinen süßen Robbe aber wesentlich angenehmer als die eines Metall-Menschen.","letzendlich haben auch die soften Roboter irgendwo die gleichen Probleme manche weniger stark, wie das komplette ersetzen aber die meisten genauso stark wie probleme mit KI und kommunikation mit der KI","Mir ist ein weiterer positiver Aspekt eingefallen, dafür entfernte ich einen negativer da dieser weniger Sinn machte nachdem wir mit Palo ein genaues Anwendungsbeispiel gezeigt wurde.","Ich denke, die Mind Map, die ich erstellt habe, passt auch gut zum Konzept der Softroboter an sich, deshalb habe ich beschlossen, nicht viel an der Map zu ändern.","Ich finde den SoftRoboter nütlicher etwas Nützlicher, da er das Opfer Versorgen kann und auch schwierig erreichbare bereiche erreichen kann.","Ich habe einen Nachteil aus der vorherigen Seite übernommen an den ich vorher nicht gedacht habe. Somit ist die Wertung negativer ausgefallen.","Ich habe mich bemüht, Vor- und Nachteile zu finden, habe aber bei der Zweiten Mind-Map einfach mehr Ideen gehabt. Persönlich bin ich sehr für die Entwicklung dieser Roboter, bin mir aber bewusst, welche bedenken andere Menschen haben/ haben könnten.","Weil ich diese Art von Softrobotern bereits in meiner ursprünglichen Mindmap bereits berücksichtigt habe. ","Ich hatte das Behandeln von psychischen Krankheiten stärker gewichtet, was allerdings auch wieder eine erhöhte Abhängigkeit bedeuten kann. Daher die minimale Steigerung","Weil roboter, egal für welchen einsatz immer die grundregeln haben das sie eben keine menschen sind. sie müssen mit wissen gefüttert werden, und durch \"trail und error\" lernen was zum erfolg oder misserfolg führt. für mich spielt es keine rolle ob soft oder hard roboter. das umfeld in den er eingesetzt wird, also der sozialbereich ist das selbe. sprich es gelten die selben regeln für beide arten der roboter. auch wenn das einsatzgebiet sich augenscheinlich ändert.","Ich empfinde die soften Roboter technisch Fortschrittlicher und fähig anspruchsvollere Probleme zu lösen. Von daher denke ich, dass eine etwas positivere Bewertung angebracht ist. Außerdem fühlte ich mich unterbewusst durch den Beschreibungstext geprimed eine positive Auffassung zu haben - wenn ich jetzt im Anschluss noch einmal darüber nachdenke. Ich finde es von Ihrer wissenschaftlichen Methodik äußerst ungünstig, dass Sie den*die Probanden*in durch die Vorstellung möglicher Vor- und Nachteile bevormunden bzw. beeinflussen. Eine neutralere Beschreibung, die nur den Anwendungszweck ohne entsprechender Bewertung halte ich für deutlich angebrachter. Leider waren für die zweite Mindmap meine Kommentare nicht mehr vorhanden. Ich weiß nicht ob dies ein technischer Defekt war und diese nicht gespeichert wurden, oder eine bewusste Entscheidung war.","Die beschriebenen soften Assistenten, können die Funktion eines Haustiers übernehmen, ohne die damit einhergehenden negativen Begleitumstände zu zeigen. Meine Vorstellung was ein sozialer Assistent alles leisten kann und welche positiven Aspekte er liefern kann ist wahrscheinlich noch etwas eingeschränkt. Erfahrungsberichte aus der Anwendung würden meine Einstellung auch noch verändern.","Da für mich die emotionale Bewertung sich zwischen Soft und generell nicht unterscheidet.","Anfänglich habe ich mir die Assistenzroboter wie \"typische\" Roboter vorgestellt, also eher \"kalt\". Die neue Beschreibung der \"soften\" Roboter hat da bei mir dann doch etwas in der Vorstellung verändert, weshalb ich die Mindmap nun etwas positiver in der emotionalen bewertung gestaltet habe (wenn auch nicht viel).","Durch die soften Roboter ist mir klar geworden, dass natürlich alle Roboter in einer Weise beschädigt oder geschädigt werden können. Egal ob soft oder normal.","Der Roboter kann sehr sinnvolle Tätigkeiten ausüben, daher hat es mich positiver beeindruckt. ","Die Akzeptanz von Robotern steigt wenn diese nicht so mechanisch und kalt wahrgenommen werden sondern freundlicher wirken.","Ich habe Aenderungen vorgenommen, da die Erklaerung für den Soften Roboter mehr positive Aspekte in den Vordergrund gerückt hat.","Ich denke, die größere Lebensähnlichkeit kann gefährlich sein.\nDiese Art der \"Softness\" öffnet die Möglichkeit für diverse Arten der Manipulation, durch beispielsweise Werbung, sobald diese Roboter auf dem Markt erhältlich wären.\nDas Risiko für eine parasoziale Beziehung zu einem soften Roboter halte ich ebenfalls für deutlich größer.","Ich sehe softe Assistenzroboter nur sehr geringfügig positiver, den ein Roboter bleibt ein Roboter und kann niemals das Gefühl eines menschlichen Kontaktes ersetzen. Trotzdem sehe ich den Einsatz in manchen Bereichen positiv, z.B können Vitalfunktionen überwacht werden oder der Roboter kann an die Medikamenteneinnahme erinnern usw.","Die Möglichkeit der Soft Roboter war mir vorher nicht bekannt; meines Empfindens haben diese Roboter weitere Vorteile gegenüber den menschenähnlichen. Dadurch kamen mehr positive Aspekte insgesamt hinzu, außerdem stelle ich mir einen weichen, tierähnlichen Roboter einfach niedlicher vor als einen maschinellen oder menschenähnlichen (uncanny Vally) ","Mehr Pünkte haben mir während der Studie eingefallen","Softe Roboter eröffnen neue Perspektiven durch die mögliche Versorgung mit Gütern und das Vermindern des Verletzungsrisikos. Die dem gegenüber stehenden Nachteile empfinde ich nicht als sonderlich erheblich.","Es kam ein weiter Aspekt hinzu, den ich nicht bedacht hatte, der aber wichtig war","es ist ein liste die unemotional und faktisch kreiert wurde. ","Weil der Roboter dadurch das er so weich ist, leichter zu beschädigen ist und dadurch potenzielle falsche Entscheidungen entstehen können.","Es war meiner Meinung nach tatsächlich nicht negativer. Ich finde beide Fälle wirklich hilfreich.","Ich habe keine Änderungen durchgeführt, da ich der meinung bin dass das Aussehen nicht einen großen Einfluss hat.","ich finde die Erläuterungen zum softer roboter haben mir aufgezeigt, dass auch lebenswichtige Versorgungsgüter gebracht werden können, was ich als positiv angesehen habe und die nachteile haben sich nicht wirklich erhöht durch den Text über den softer roboter. ","Meine Meinung bezüglich der Vor- und Nachteile hat sich nicht verändert.","Ich halte das beschriebene Szenario mit dem Soft-Roboter für keine gute Idee, außer in technischer Hinsicht, wo vielleicht Verletzungen durch das Rettungsgerät vermieden werden. Aber wenn ich mir vorstelle, dass ich in einem Ausnahmezustand, z.b. Schock nach Naturkatastrophe befinde und dann kommt die Nachbildung einer Schlange (zugespitzt jetzt formuliert) löst das eher noch weitere Ängste aus. Wenn es als MAschine erkennbar ist, dann weiß der Patient wenigstens was los ist und wird nicht zusätzlich verwirrt.","Weil ich den Punkt des fehlenden sozialen Kontakts durch softe Roboter nicht mehr als relevant ansehe. Wenn Menschen mit diesen Robotern kommunizieren können und dieses Verhalten eventuell irgendwann Menschlichen Kontakt repräsentieren kann, sehe ich diesen Punkt nicht mehr","Ich denke, dass der softe Roboter eine emotionale Abhängigkeit und Krisensituationen hervorrufen kann.","umso mehr ein Mensch einen Roboter menschliche Züge zuschreibt, umso:\n- stärker wird auch die psychische Abhängigkeit\n- es kommt eher zu Fehlinterpretationen des Gegenübers - zwischen Mensch und Roboter\n was nachteilig sein kann","Weichheit kann positiver und realistischer wahrgenommen werden","Ich hatte schon im Voraus von Soft-Robotern gehört, hatte sie aber im Kontext von Rettunseinsätzen nicht berücksichtigt.","Das Menschen eine emotionale Bindung zu Robotern aufbauen können, ist sowohl negativ als auch positiv. Jedoch kann ein Roboter keinen Menschen im sozialen Umgang ersetzten und eine zu große soziale Abhängigkeit zu einem Roboter ist meiner Meinung nach schlecht für einen Menschen. ","Nach dem Lesen des zweiten Textes zu Soft-Robotern sind mir mehr \"unschönere\", negative Situationen oder Aspekte eingefallen, die ich zu meiner Mindmap hinzugefügt habe. Das bedeutet nicht, dass meine Meinung negativ ist - vielmehr fielen mir mehr negative Aspekte ein als positive.","Der Aspekt der Versorgung von z.B. Eingeschlossenen war vorher noch nicht berücksichtigt.","Weil die mangelnde Präzision aufgrund der Verwendung von Weichteilen als weiterer, d.h. zusätzlicher Nachteil hinzukam.","weil ich kein andere Meinung habe.","Ich kenne das Konzept von Soft-Robotern und ich hoffe zu einem großen Teil, dass sie nützlich darin sein werden, Menschen zu unterstützen. Ich kann niemals akzeptieren, dass Roboter eine menschliche Therapie durchführen sollen. Als Assistenz für Menschen in der Pflege und zum Garantieren der Sicherheit der Patienten würde ich sie jedoch gerne nehmen und hoffe, dass es Menschen durch solche Mittel besser gehen wird.","Mir ist im Laufe des Textes über Soft-Roboter bewusst geworden, dass die vielen positiven Aspekte (Emotionsregulierung zum Beispiel wie bei Paro) vor der Möglichkeit eines möglichen Datenmissbrauchs in den Hintergrund tritt. Mir stellt sich die Frage der Kommerzialisierung solcher Roboter. Also ob zum Beispiel Verhaltensdaten gesammelt werden, wie diese Daten verwertet werden und ob sie im Endeffekt bewusst genutzt werden, um eine Abhängigkeit von dem Produkt zu erzeugen, etc. Ich glaube, dass sehr viel Potential gerade in soften - Sozialen Assistenz- Robotern steckt. Ich wäre aber vorsichtig bei dem Gedanken, wer hinter der Entwicklung und Investition in solchen Robotern steckt und inwiefern sich die vorteilhafte Nutzung rentiert gegenüber negativen Aspekten wie der Missbrauch von privaten Daten. ","Ich hatte bei der Bearbeitung der Mind Map technische Probleme, bzw. öffnete sich das Tool zur Bearbeitung automatisch, bevor ich den Briefing-Text vollständig lesen konnte. Ich habe daher nach Gefühl angepasst und hoffe, es gab keine spezifischeren Instruktionen bzgl. der Mind Map Anpassung.\n\nAllgemein hatte ich bei Assistenzrobotern viel an harte Pflegetätigkeiten wie die Betreuung von kranken und älteren Menschen gedacht. Die \"soften\" Faktoren haben mich daher etwas positiver über das Konzept denken lassen, weil ich es für einen niedrigeschwelligen und gefahrenärmeren Einsatz von Robotern halte.","Die Verwendung von Robotern zum direkten Transport von Wasser war ein zusätzlicher Vorteil","Ich hatte zuvor ein potentielles Verletzungsrisiko durch Roboteinsatz in meiner anfänglichen Mind-Map nicht bedacht, finde es aber einen sehr relevanten Punkt.","Die angepasste Mind-Map wurde positiver, da sich durch den Einsatz von soften Rettungsrobotern mehr Einsatzmöglichkeiten ergeben, an welche ich primar gedacht habe. Ich habe natürlich auch an eventuell negative Aspekte gedacht und meine Gefühle auch in vorhandenen Kategorien (z.B. mit Kommentaren) untergebracht.","Weil einige zusätzliche Schwachpunkte des Roboters dazu gekommen sind  ","Ich denke, dass die Gefahren der Möglichkeit weniger präzise zu sein und potentiell so das Opfer zu schaden überwiegt gegenüber der Minderung des Verletzungsrisikos durch ein weicheres Gehäuse. Die Betrachtung der Gefahr, dass der Roboter möglichweise eher kaputt gehen könnte ist im Bezug auf Menschenrettung zu vernachlässigen.","weil es um spezifische Interaktionen ging (Mensch-Tier) und nicht um allgemeine Mensch-Mensch Interaktionen. Das ist ethisch unproblematischer","Es gab mehr Nachteile als Vorteile","Zunächst halte ich die Einführung von Robotern in der Pflege als unausweichlich angesichts der alternden Bevölkerung und den Schwierigkeiten Arbeitskräfte zu finden. Der technologische Fortschritt kommt und wird Roboter zunehmend menschlicher erscheinen lassen, so dass viele Nachteile mit der Zeit aufgehoben werden. Wie bei allen Geräten bzw. Technologien werden diese am Anfang Kinderkrankheiten aufweisen und es zu Unfällen kommen. Durch \"softe\" Roboter könnten diese Unfälle eventuell verhindert werden oder weniger schlimm sein. Sonst habe ich nicht viel geändert.","Anhand des Beispiel des Softroboters der bereits schon im Einsatz ist, konnte ich noch weitere positive Eigenschaften in Erfahrung bringen, die mir vorher nicht bewusst waren da ich mich in dem Themenbereich bisher nicht ausgekannt habe.","Da ich nicht an Softroboter gedacht habe und dadurch mir mehr negative gedanken gekommen sind wie man diese Roboter auch missbrauchen könnte für ,,Böse'' zwecke","Die Gefahren von Softrobotern können verheerend sein. Durch die verniedlichung werden Menschen die soziale Probleme haben eher angesprochen. Dadurch können Emotionen und Handlungen einfacher manipuliert werden als mit Menschen oder menschlichen Robotern","Da im vorhergegangenen Text die Steuerung durch den Menschen betont wurde, zumindes noch, meiner Meinung nach sollten solche Rettungsroboter immer vom Menschen und nicht von KI gesteuert werden.","In meinen Augen hat sich an der Situation nichts geändert, daher habe ich gleich bewertet","Die potentielle Beschädigung softer Roboter ist ein großer Nachteil. Insgesamt habe ich aber eine sehr positive Einstellung zu Rettungsrobotern und die Vorteile überwiegen deutlich. Ein Problem bzgl. Diskriminierung bei dem Einsatz sehe ich nicht.","Weil die Informationen zu Soften Rettungsrobotern mit dem Beispiel des der ETH Zürich überzeugend waren und ein positiveres Bild bei mir erzeugt haben.","Das ist meine Idee","Ich habe vorher nicht an softe Roboter gedacht, aber ich denke sie würden für eine  spürbare Verbesserung der Therapien oder der Betreuung führen, sobald sie ausgereift genug sind, akzeptiert werden und, je nach Roboter, das Personal im Umgang damit geschult ist.","Neu erhaltene Informationen haben meine Meinung nicht geändert. ","Ich habe einige positive Punkte zu soften Robotern hinzugefügt, weil mir eher die Vorteile in Erinnerung geblieben sind.","Der Text zu den Softrobotern hatte zusätzliche Vorteile, welche mir persönlich entfallen sind. Die negativen Bewertungen hatte ich bereits in leicht abgewandelter Form in meiner Mind-Map aufgenommen.","Ich denke nicht, dass meine Einstellung nach Lesen des Textes negativer geworden ist, sondern mir ist nur einen Nachteil mehr im Sinne gekommen. Dies hätte aber auch  ohne den Text zu lesen, passieren können, wahrscheinlich, wenn ich mehr Zeit zum Erstellen des Mind-Maps gehabt hätte","Mir ist aufgefallen, dass Roboter negativ benutzt werden können oder durch Fehlfunktionen Leben gefährden können.","Paro sieht aus wie ein angenehm weiches Kuscheltier, das sich streicheln lässt und sogar entsprechend mit dem Schwanz wackeln kann. Diesem \"Spielzeug\" kann sich kaum jemand entziehen. Die Menschen (und erst recht die Kinder) werden sicher sofort neugierig und wollen es anfassen. Daraufhin wird Paro wohl mit kleinen Bewegungen reagieren und seine großen Kulleraugen auf- und zumachen. Ein kuschelig weicher Roboter, der sich sanft und gleichmäßig bewegt, steht im völligen Gegensatz zu einem eckigen, technisch ausehenden Roboter.","weil Roboter so funktionieren, dass sie ähnliche Aufgaben ausführen,","Durch das natürlichere Auftreten der Soft Roboter, denke ich ist es einfacher eine emotionale Bindung zum Roboter aufzubauen. Man denkt sich beim Angesicht von einer Robbe zum Beispiel das diese niedlich aussieht, woraufhin man beim normalen Roboter dieses Gefühl nicht hat.","Ich habe die Darstellung der positiven Eigenschaften \"softer Roboter\" als potenzielle Schwächen von sozialen Assistenzrobotern angesehen, die ich zunächst nicht bedacht hatte. Diese habe ich dann ergänzt.","Mir wurde durch den zuvor angezeigten Text nochmals die Möglichkeit der Voreingenommenheit von Rettungsrobotern ins Gedächtnis gerufen. Ich hatte zuvor vergessen, diesen Aspekt negativ kodiert in meiner Mind-Map zu inkludieren. Zusätzlich fiel mir ein neutraler Faktor ein, da mir bewusst wurde, dass die unterschiedlichen Macharten solcher Roboter einen an ihre Fertigkeiten und Bauart angebassten Einsatz erfordern.","Gesunde Skepsis gegenüber neuer Technologie","Der Robotikerprozesse haben allgemein ähnlivhe Eigenschaften. Meiner Meinung hach war es keine emotionale Angabe. Was man in dem Prozess eigentlich braucht kann in bestimmter Phase Ähnlichkeit zeigen. ","Es kamen mit den Softrobotern noch weitere Vorteile dazu, die ich nicht berücksichtigt hatte.","Weil ich glaube, dass die Soft Roboter menschen-ähnlicher sind und deshalb eine emotionalere Nähe aufbauen können zu den Pflegenden als normale Assistenzroboter","Die Erklärung der soften Roboter hat mir eher Vorteile gezeigt, als wirkliche Nachteile.","Durch die Versorgung der Opfer wurde diese positiver. Ich finde, dass ist ein wichtiger Punkt, vorallem bei Erdbeben-Szenarien, wo es schwierig ist an die Opfer dran zu kommen, bzw. diese zu versorgen, kann dies essenziell sein.","Ein Roboter der nicht als solcher optisch wahrnembar ist, kann besonders einfach missbraucht werden, z.B. zum Ausspähen.","Ich denke, dass Tierähnliche Roboter eine gute Sache sein können, insbesonders bei Kindern, die vielleicht große Angst haben. Softe Roboter können daher eventuell dafür Sorgen, dass die Kinder ruhig bleiben können. Auch bei Erwachsenen kann dies helfen.","Die möglichen Nachteile, die ich im Text gelesen habe, hielt ich nicht für sehr realistisch, so dass in meiner Mind-Map, die Vorteile überwogen.","Ich kann theoretisch Assistenzroboter akzeptieren - vor allem, wenn den Hilfebedürftigen die Wahl gelassen wird. Es ist vorstellbar, dass eine nicht unwesentliche Anzahl von Menschen einen Roboter ihren überforderten und manchmal ungeduldigen menschlichen Helfern vorziehen würden. Gar nicht akzeptieren kann ich Roboter, die etwas vorspiegeln, was sie (wenigstens in absehbarer Zukunft) nicht sein können. Die Reaktion des Roboters auf den Menschen wird durch ein Programm gesteuert, das im besten (oder schlechtesten ...) Fall sehr adäquat reagiert, so dass der Mensch Zuwendung und Sympathie registriert. Wenn das nötig ist, um Menschen mit Zuwendung zu \"versorgen\", ist unsere Gesellschaft in meinen Augen gescheitert!","Ich denke, dass softe Roboter Vorteile hinzufügen können, jedoch keine komplett neuen Nachteile mit sich bringen.","Es herrscht noch zu viel Ungewissheit und Klärungsbedarf, fiktionale Filme wie AI zeigen die Gefahren von solchen Robotern","Das war keine bewusste Entscheidung. Ich habe den Nachteil der möglichen Diskriminierung durch einen Roboter hinzugefügt, vermutlich führte dies zu einer negativeren Bewertung.","hm, das unveränderte durchschnittliche emotionale Rating von 0,85 in der angepassten Cognitive-Affective Map, verglichen mit der ursprünglichen Karte, deutet darauf hin, dass die Wahrnehmung und das Verständnis der dargestellten Themen oder Konzepte konstant geblieben sind. Es zeigt, dass die Anpassungen an der Karte die gesamte emotionale oder affektive Reaktion auf den Inhalt nicht wesentlich verändert haben, was auf eine stabile Sichtweise oder Einstellung zu den in der Karte behandelten Themen hindeutet.","Ich habe anfangs eher die Vorteile gesehen. Später ergab sich ein differenzierteres Bild. ","Weil es aus meiner Sicht in diesem Zusammenhang der zweiten Mind Map mehr Vorteile gab ","Sollte eigentlich nicht so sein. Ich sehe bei Softrobotern ein großes Potential bessere Ergebnisse zu liefern. Den einzigen negativ Punkt den ich angemerkt habe ist, dass man evtl. zu viel Energie in das Entwickeln der Ästhetik setzt anstatt in die Funtionalität","die angepasste mind map zu soften rettungsrobotern erhalt konzepte wie beschadigung und potenzielle unprazasion die negative aspekte betonen dies konnte zu einer leicht negativieren wahr nehmung im vergleich zum ursprunglichen mindmap fuhren die sich mehr auf allgemeine vorteile und nach teile von rettungsrobotern konzentierte","Aufgrund des Materials, das für die Herstellung dieser Roboter verwendet wird, und ich dachte an eon höheres Risiko eines Missbrauchs, als ich die Details über den Roboter las. \naber im Allgemein halte ich es für eine großartige Idee, die einen Versuch wert ist!\nMene Befrüchtungen hinsichtlich eines Missbrauchs sind wahrscheinlich auf die Nachrichten über \"shadow fleet\" zurückführen und darauf, dass russland und china Sanktionen nutzen, um sich zu bereichern ","Ich hatte in der ersten Mind-Map vergessen, den Vorteil der Versorgung von zu rettenden Personen einzuzeichnen. Dieser wurde im zweiten Text nochmal erwähnt. Dementsprechend habe ich die Mind-Map ergänzt.","Die soften Roboter haben nochmal die technische Anfälligkeit und mögliche Ausfälle verdeutlicht.","Die Informationen zu Softrobotern hat mir nicht wirklich einen neuen postiven Aspekt einfallen lassen, aber ein negativer Aspekt ist mir klar geworden.","Ich finde tatsächlich nicht, dass die angepasste Map merkbar negativer war. Alles in allem denke ich, dass die Vorteile beider Maps überwiegen. Zwar gibt es ein Paar negative Punkte, welche man nicht vergessen sollte, jedoch erschließt sich deutlich mehr positiver Nutzen, besonders in einer Zeit, in welcher Arbeitskräfte und individuelle Behandlung fehlen. ","Ich denke, wenn diese Rettungrobotern ethischerweise genutzt werden, können sie noch technologisch weiter entwickelt werden und viele Leben retten ohne den Rettungskraft im Gefahr zu setzen. ","Eventuell liegt es daran das ich bisher noch keine Erfahrung in diesem Bereich sammeln konnte, und dadurch auch besser anwenden kann.","Ich habe die angepasste Mind-Map eigentlich positiver wahrgenommen, da die sich durch softe Rettungsroboter ergebenen Vorteile die die Nachteile überwiegen.","Ich denke dadurch dass die soften Roboter als tierähnlich beschrieben wurden, habe ich sie automatisch als positiver eingeschätzt, ohne dass es mir wirklich aufgefallen ist. Man kann eher eine emotionale Verbindung zu ihnen aufbauen, sie ersetzen aber weniger einen Menschen (was moralisch gesehen kritischer bewertet werden könnte), sondern eher ein (Haus-)Tier, was ich moralisch gesehen weniger verwerflich ansehe, da der Mensch nicht mehr so stark ersetzt wird.","Ich denke, Rettungsroboter sind unverzichtbar. Ich komme aus der Türkei. Und mein Land wurde von einem Erdbeben erschüttert. Und die Technik hätte mehr Leben retten können. Weiche Roboter klingen gut, wenn auch zu idealistisch. Aber wenn sie arbeiten, haben sie Vorteile. Sie würden eher zur Navigation, Überwachnung, Kommunikation und Zustellung eigesetzt. Selbst wenn es zu einer Fehlfunktion käme, wäre dies nicht katastrophal. ","Ich habe zwei weitere positiv bewertete Eigenschaften, die mit der Möglichkeit, Menschen an sonst möglicherweise unerreichbaren Orten mit Nahrung versorgen zu können, hinzugefügt. Das Argument hatte ich in der Mind-Map zuvor nicht einbezogen.","Die eventuell spielzeugähnliche Erscheinung von soften Robotern könnte einen negativen Einfluss haben, wenn Beobachter bzw. Entscheider einen solchen Roboter als Spielzeug oder Spielerei wahrnehmen und bewerten.","Je länger ich mich gedanklich mit dem Thema auseinander gesetzt habe, desto mehr Nachteile fielen mir letztlich ein.","rettungsroboter müssen noch weiterentwickelt werden.","Weil sich durch die nachträglich vorgestellte Variante der Rettungsroboter einige weitere, vorteilhafte, Einsatzmöglichkeiten ergeben haben.","Für mich wirkt es so, als hätten softe Assistenzroboter zwar die gleiche Anzahl an Nachteilen wie nicht softe, aber ein paar mehr Vorteile.","Ich denke, dass man stabile Roboter bauen muss, damit diese nicht wie mögliche weiche Roboter leicht kaputtgehen können.","Ich bin mehr auf den emotionalen Aspekt der Thematik eingegangen und welche gesellschaftlichen/politischen und menschlichen Probleme diese mit sich bringen würden. Ebenfalls habe ich versucht, mich in verschiedene Rollen hineinzuversetzen und sie daraus zu betrachten.","weniger widerstandsfähige Materialen","Durch Beeinflussung der Interaktionen können die falsche Entscheidungen getroffen werden.","Meine Meinung nicht geändert. Ich arbeite mit Behinderten und weis wovon ich rede.","Ich habe bereits auch Roboter dieser Art mit in meine Gedanken mit einfließen lassen","Die Beschreibung der soften Roboter hat meine Meinung nicht geändert. Die emotionale Bewertung von 0 kann ich nicht nachvollziehen, da ich Roboter als ambivalentes Konzept angegeben habe.","Ich hab das Mind-Map nich verändert, da mein Mind-Map generell ist, gilt für beide Themen, egal ob ein \"noramler\" Robotter oder ein weicher Roboter","Ich sehe großes Potential von Robotern in sozialen Berufen. Vor allem denke ich, dass ein Roboter für viele Menschen (Alte, behinderte, etc.) wie ein Freund oder Haustier fungieren kann. Dies kann einen immensen positiven Effekt auf die Person haben, was durch das soft-roboter Beispiel noch deutlicher wurde. Allerdings entstehen auch Risiken, wie in meiner Mindmap dargelegt wie soziale Abhängigkeit oder Manipulation durch den Robotern. ","Es wurden mir mögliche negative Nachteile aufgezeigt, die mir zu Beginn so nicht bewusst waren.","Die beschriebene Anpassungsfähigleit der Roboter hat mir etwas die Sorge genommen, dass diese Roboter möglicherweise schnell zerstört werden könnten","Da die zusätzliche Information, dass es um softe Roboter geht, bei mir eher positive als negative Assoziationen hervorruft","Die Anfälligkeit von Robotern zu Fehlern oder Schäden an der Technik sind ein nicht zu vernachlässigendes Kriterium. ","wegen die Flexibilität der soften Rettungsroboter","Ich habe die Anpassungsfähigkeit von Robotern nicht bedacht, weil mir Silikon basierte Roboter nicht bekannt waren.","Denn auf der Grundlage der angegebenen Studie sind beides Sozialhilferoboter","ich habe mehr inspiration bekommen, durch die beispiele und durch mein selbstständiges nachdenken","Ich bin der Meinung, dass ich einige der Positiven Punkte bereits im ersten Teil der Mind-Map integriert hatte. Die Beeinflussung der Reaktionen und des Verhaltens durch die Interaktion mit einem Roboter hatte ich noch nicht aufgenommen und ergänzt. \nGrundsätzlich hat mir die Beschreibung des Soft Roboters positiver gestimmt, da es sich um ein Zwischenschritt zum menschähnlichen sozialen Roboter handelt. Erst einmal ein Haustier, das schon gewisse Bedürfnisse stillen kann. \nUnd ich mag Robben. ","Die  aufgeführten Vor- und Nachteile im Vorhinein waren sehr ähnlich, für mich macht die Beschaffenheit keinen großen Unterschied","weil ich kein andere Meinung habe, deswegen es it gleich geblieben ","Ich glaube, ich habe aufgeschrieben, was ich in diesem Moment fülhte","Mir ist bei dem Beispiel mit dem Tier aufgefallen, dass allgemein die Kosten niedriger sein werden als wenn man echte Menschen oder Tiere dafür einsetzt. Sonst hat das Beispiel jedoch nix mehr an meiner Mindmap geändert.","Weil ich die zweite Roboterart mehr als Unterstützung für Therapie, soz Interkation etc gesehen habe und nicht als Ersatz","Ganz ehrlich, ich habe vergessen die emotionale Bewertungen einzustellen. \n\nWas ich aber sagen kann, ich sehe soziale Assisstenzroboter nach Einführung der Konzept \"soft Roboter\" nicht positiver an. Ich sehe einfach nicht wie soft Roboter, die keine Gespräche führen können aber auf Streicheln reagieren können, so hilfreich sein können. Wenn Streicheln, dann eher echte Haustiere meine Meinung nach. ","Durch die Informationen des flexiblen/soften Roboter kann ich mir vorstellen, dass die Effizienz des Roboters massiv gesteigert werden kann und das ist natürlich ein weiterer positiver Punkt.","Ich bin von den soften Robotern nicht begeistert und kann sie mir nur schlecht vorstellen.","Ich denke, dass diese Roboter niedlicher aussehn, wenn man sie wie Haustiere oder Spielzeuge aussehen lasst.","Die Beschreibung der softeren Roboter hat ein paar negative Punkte aufgeworfen.","Die letzte Mindmaps ist für mich präziser. Nach den mir gegebenen Formationen konnte ich es am Ende noch weiter modifizieren. Ich wähle das letzte.","Es ist egal, aus welchem Stoff die Roboter sind, die Argumente bleiben die gleichen.","Ich bin allgemein positiv gegenüber Rettungsrobotern eingestellt","Ich kann verschieden Bücher lesen. Oder über diese Thema recherchieren...","Der gewonnene Sicherheitsaspekt durch die flauschige / weniger gefährliche Art der Gestaltung (positive Veränderung) wurde durch den Verlust an simulierter menschlicher Interaktion (negative Veränderung) wieder wettgemacht. In Bezug auf die Vorteile hat sich für mich keine Veränderung ergeben.","Als Rettungsroboter halte ich Roboter aus weichen Materialien nicht für eine geeignete Idee.","Weil ich den Nachteil mit der Beschädigung und die Präzision nicht beachtet habe, daher sind nur auf der negativen Seite Punkte hinzugekommen. Allerdings sehe ich die Rettungsroboter nicht negativer sondern immer noch gleich.","Die Ergänzung von Robotern die mehr auf Soziale Kontakte programmiert sind kann weitreichende Probleme verhindern - auch wenn das Konzept als solches nicht positiv ist. ","Nach dem Lesen denke ich, dass die Technologie noch neu ist und es mehr Nachteile als Vorteile gibt","Weil ich soziale Roboter eher als menschen ähnliche Wesen erachtet habe, die zu eher zu Problemen führen.\nSo ein kleiner softer Roboter in Form einer Robbe, wirkt eher wie ein Haustier mit zusätzlichen Funktionen.\nHaustiere sind meiner Meinung nach viel einfacher unterzubringen als quasi einen weiteren Menschen, bzw. etwas mensch ähnliches.\nVor allem so kleine Helfer sind bestimmt preiswerter, weit verbreiteter einsetzbar und können in viel mehr Situationen einfach und gleichzeitig nicht so auffällig unterstützen und helfen.","Ich bin der Meinung das meine Bewertung gut passt.","Durch das Menschen- bzw. Tierähnlichere Erscheinungsbild sehe ich ein höheres Risiko für emotionale Abhängigkeit und negative Persönlichkeitsveränderungen bzw. einer Abnahme von sozialer Kompetenz ","Softe Rettungsroboter scheinen mir positiver, weil hier vorallem weniger Machtmissbrauch stattfinden kann. Außerdem erscheinen mir diese - solange keine allumfassend gültige Ethik für den Umgang mit KI vorhanden ist - geeigneter.","Am Anfang fielen mir nur die positiven Dinge besonders auf, also was eine solche Technologie möglich machen kann und wie diese unsere Gesellschaft verbessern kann. Je länger ich darüber nachgedacht habe umso mehr kam mir in den Sinn das es gewisse Probleme mit einer solchen Technik gibt. Man stellt sich genaue Szenarien vor und ist sich unsicher ob ein Roboter moralisch oder voreingenommen handelt.","Ich hatte davor nicht realisiert, dass durch Schlauchsysteme Hilfsmittel in schwer zugängliche Bereiche geliefert werden kann.","Meiner Meinung nach, bringen Soft Roboter derzeit mehr Nachteile als ihre Vorteile.","weil ich von der idee der soften roboter beeindruckt war","Diverse Nachteile/Bedenken wurden durch das Konzept des soften Roboters entschärft, insbesondere alles was die Interaktion mit den Betroffenen angeht.","Nach dem Text über die Soft-Roboter sind mir weitere Vorteile in den Sinn gekommen die mir vorher nicht bewusst waren.","nachdem ich über die Soft-Roboter gelesen hatte, mussten einige Vorteile angepasst oder gelöscht werden. Ich musste auch einige Nachteile neu überdenken und sie zur Mind-Map hinzufügen","Es gab mehr Dinge, die aufgekommen sind durch die zusätzlichen Informationen. Ich würde aber sagen, dass 0.47 mit 0.5 vergleichbar ist. Insgesamt ist die emotionale Bewertung doch ausgewogen.","Weil hier der Mensch noch mehr Möglichkeiten zur Einflussnahme auf den Roboter hat als bei einem völlig autarken System. Außerdem sehe ich bei so einem System erstmal keine ethischen Bedenken im Sinne von Bewusstsein des Roboters.","Ich denke nicht, dass es wesentliche Unterschiede zwischen den Vor un Nachteilen von herkömmlichen Robotern und weichen Robotern gibt.","Weil normaler Rettungsroboter vorteilhafter ist","Ich fand softer Roboter begeistert","soften Robotern haben mehr Vorteile als anders.","Die soften Roboter scheinen mir nicht ganz so gefährlich. Insbesondere weil sie von einer Person gesteuert werden.

Vielleicht könnte der Roboter diese finden? ","Alleine das Wort \"Soft\" Roboter (Sanfter Roboter) vermittelt einen positiveren Eindruck als das Wort \"Autonomer\" Roboter. Autonom wiederum klingt auch nicht negativ, es klingt einfach neutraler. Ausserdem wurde beschrieben, dass die soft robots menschen/tierähnliche Bewegungen nachahmen, was sie wiederum personifiziert.

Mehr Informationen zu dem Einsatz von Assistenten hätten mich interessiert.","","Sehr interessante und spannende Umfrage!","","","","","","","Der Teil mit der Richtung der Beeinflussung im Hilfe-Menü des CAM-Programms sollte noch entfernt werden, ansonsten finde ich das Programm und die Studien dazu sehr interessant.","","","","n/a","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","nein , alles war gut","","","Spannende Studie, viel Erfolg!","","","Wenn möglich, wäre es gut, wenn Sie einen sichtbaren Timer für die Mind-Map Erstellung hinzufügen können. Durch den Vollbildmodus konnte ich meine Desktop-Uhr nicht sehen, und war mir dann nicht ganz sicher mit der Zeit, was mich gefühlt etwas unter Druck setzte. Aber abgesehen davon lief alles super und ich fand das Thema interessant. Es hat mich neugierig gemacht, nach dieser Studie mal nach soften Robotern zu googeln. Ich wünsche Ihnen viel Erfolg bei Ihrer Forschung!","Tolle Studie ","","","","","","","Richtig interessante Studie","","","","","","","","","","","/","Ein kleiner Schreibfehler ist mir im letzten Teil aufgefallen (ganz unten auf der Seite): \"wüden\" anstatt \"würden\".","","","","","","","","","Beim Ein- und Austritt in die CAM Software wurde automatisch kurz mein Browserfenster aus dem Vollbildmodus geschaltet, woraufhin ich einen Hinweis bekam, ich solle dies nicht tun. Ansonsten lief alles gut.","","Die letzten fragen \"zum Roboter\" - es ist unklar ob es sich auf den ersten Roboter (allgemein) oder den neuen (soften) bezieht.","","","Ich erstelle nicht gern Mindmaps (weil ich meine Gedanken zu einem Thema lieber ganz einfach schriftlich formuliere) und habe keine Übung darin. Außerdem musste ich meine Gedanken zum Thema Assistenzroboter erstmal sammeln. Daher fand ich den Zeitdruck, unter dem ich die Mindmap anfertigen musste, sehr unangenehm. Ich hatte die Map erst halb fertig, als mir signalisiert wurde, ich müsse jetzt zum Ende kommen. Abgeben durfte ich sie in diesem Zustand aber nicht. Auf diese Weise wird kaum etwas Sinnvolles zustandekommen!","","","","Gerne gebe ich ein Feedback zur Online-Studie: Es wäre hilfreich, die Anweisungen und Beispiele zur Erstellung der Cognitive-Affective Maps noch detaillierter und klarer zu gestalten, um die Genauigkeit und Tiefe der Teilnehmerantworten zu verbessern. Darüber hinaus könnte eine interaktivere Plattform die Benutzererfahrung verbessern und zu präziseren Ergebnissen führen.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Verbindungsstriche der Mind-Map waren eher irritierend. Zeitfenster für die erste Mind-Map hätte etwas länger sein können. Überarbeitung der Mind-Map in Bezug auf Softroboter als nur wenig relevant empfunden. Sehr interessante Studie durch Nutzung der Mind-Map.","","","","","",".","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ich finde die beiden vordefinierten Felder Vorteile/Nachteile eher hinderlich in der Beschreibung. In meinem Mindset definiert sich ein Vorteil z.B. dadurch, dass ich dem positiv gestimmt bin. Dadurch sind die Felder für mich redundant und haben zu einer merkwürdigen Anordnung und Querverbindungen geführt. \nAnsonsten ein sehr interessantes Thema. Danke!","","nein ales war in Ordnung ","","","","","Ich empfand die Studie als sehr interessant und ich konnte wirklich meine Einstellung auf die Mindmap bringen.","Kein Feedback.","","Es halt alles gut funktioniert, es gab keine technischen Probleme.","Die Studie war sehr interessant, aber die Erstellung von Mindmaps war für diese Forschung etwas zu kompliziert.Es sollte eine bessere Option geben.","","","","","","","","","","Bis auf ein Paar Schreibfehler keine Beanstandungen oder sonstige Verbesserungsvorschläge.","","","","","","","","","nein","Es waren ein paar Tippfehler in den Fragen und auch in den Instruktionen fand ich die Wortanzahl verwirrend (die bezog sich, wenn ich es richtig verstanden hab, auf die Kommentare wo es ja kein Limit gab)","","","","","Keine","","","","Nein","","","Bis auf eine kleine technische Hürde vor der zweiten Mindmap (Überarbeitung) war die Studie gut strukturiert und verständlich","","freut mich, dass es so eine Studie gibt. Vielleicht wird die Welt dadurch besser?","Wenn die Gedanken blockieren, dann fällt es schwer die MindMap auszufüllen. Ich habe mir Mühe gegeben, mir fehlte es aber an Gedanken um schnell und einfach auf die 10 geforderten Punkte zu kommen.","","","","","Coole Studie, vielen Dank und viel Erfolg!","","","/","schöne studie",""]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>meanDifferencesCAMs<\/th>\n      <th>ans1<\/th>\n      <th>feedback_critic<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"pageLength":5,"columnDefs":[{"className":"dt-right","targets":1},{"orderable":false,"targets":0},{"name":" ","targets":0},{"name":"meanDifferencesCAMs","targets":1},{"name":"ans1","targets":2},{"name":"feedback_critic","targets":3}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false,"lengthMenu":[5,10,25,50,100]}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
