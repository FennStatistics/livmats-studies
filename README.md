- [basal attributes - analysis files](https://github.com/FennStatistics/livmats-studies/tree/main/Studies/basalAttributes) (CAM-App version 2.0)
    + for a publication (working title): <i>Using basal attributes to identify key properties to increase the acceptance of new material systems</i>



## How to download / run these studies: 

- 
- analysis CAM data: a **CAM-App** was programmed in Shiny using the R environment (+ Python modules) to analyze Cognitive-Affective Map data:
    + locally:
        + download the CAM-App from the GitHub repository: https://github.com/Camel-app/DataAnalysisR (use .git or download it manutally -> green button "<>Code" -> "Download ZIP")
        + if not already installed, download R and RStudio
        + open the file app.R, install packages if needed, click on "Run App"
    + online (! disadvantage: App is way slower):
        + open the link: https://fennapps.shinyapps.io/CAMtools_CAMapp/
